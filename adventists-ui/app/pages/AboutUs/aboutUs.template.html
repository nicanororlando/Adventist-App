    South American headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is
    responsible for administrative coordination in eight countries with more
    than two million members. The Seventh-day Adventist Church has the following

  <h3>Adventist Lifestyle</h3>
  <p>
    Adventists believe in a life of consecration to God in the physical,
    psychological, emotional and spiritual aspects. His lifestyle is based on
    eight natural remedies: water, rest, physical exercise, sunlight, fresh air,
    balanced nutrition, temperance, and hope in God. One of the principles that
    distinguishes them is rest on Saturday, a day set aside by God for a greater
    and better relationship with their children. Adventists trust God to work in
    all areas of their lives and are confident that Christ will return soon to
    reward those who have trusted in Him.

  <h3>Communication with God</h3>
  <p>
    Adventists believe that the best way to communicate with God is through
    prayer, Bible study, and good testimony. Prayer consists of seeking God's
    presence every morning, daily Bible study, is recognized as a way of
    listening to divine guidance, and testimony is the natural result of this
    communion as a habit in the life of each believer.
